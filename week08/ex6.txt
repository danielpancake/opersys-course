# A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. How many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table?

16-bit virtual addresses means that the address space is 2^16 bytes. 8 KB pages means that the page size is 8 * 1024 = 8192 = 2^13 bytes. So the number of entries in the page table is 2^16 / 2^13 = 2^3 = 8.
