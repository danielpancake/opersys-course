# Try to construct a sequence of references that will result in increased or decreased Hit/Miss ratio

One way to *increase* Hit/Miss ratio is to construct sequence in such a way that all references for the same page are grouped together. For example, the reference string 2,1,3,4,2,1,4,2,3,2 should be changed to 2,2,2,2, 1,1, 3,3, 4,4.

For the given input file, this approach will result in Hit/Miss ratio of 0.6 for all number of page frames (except 0 or less).

To *decrease* Hit/Miss ratio, the references should be distributed in such a way that no reference for a page is grouped together, that is the page will be flushed just before the next reference to it occurs. For example, with number of page frames of 3 the reference string 2,1,3,4,2,1,4,2,3,2 should be changed to 2,1,3,4 2,1,3,4, 2,2.

For the given input file, this approach will result in the following Hit/Miss ratio:

| Number of page frames | Hit/Miss ratio | Hits | Misses |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ---- | ------ |
| 10                    | 0.001          | 1    | 999    |
| 50                    | 0.024          | 24   | 976    |
| 100                   | 0.076          | 71   | 929    |
